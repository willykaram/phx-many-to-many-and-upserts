# MyAppPhx

This example is intended to implement the app outlined in Platformatec's "Many to many and upserts" blog post](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2016/12/many-to-many-and-upserts/) in Phoenix 1.3

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
